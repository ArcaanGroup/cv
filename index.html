      Key contributions were made to enhance human capital management systems for the premier e-commerce platform in Iran, effectively collaborating on various modules designed to bolster employee engagement and organizational performance. The 'Kudos Module' was conceptualized and implemented to foster a positive workplace culture, alongside the development of a dynamic Access Management system to accurately tailor user permissions. Database queries were optimized to substantially improve system performance, and software deployments were managed with a rigorous focus on security and adherence to continuous integration practices in line with OWASP standards.
