      <p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Snapp!</strong>
          <p>
            Sophisticated data-intensive tools were developed to harness user
            feedback, resulting in accurate mapping data and facilitating the
            establishment of an OpenStreetMap (OSM) mirror in Iran. Multiple
            services were migrated to Kubernetes, significantly enhancing the
            scalability and reliability of the platform’s operations. Critical
            services were rewritten to align with clean architectural
            principles, achieving a remarkable throughput of over 1400
            requests per second, while mentoring junior engineers to cultivate
            a culture of collaboration and professional development within the
            team.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Digikala.com</strong>
          <p>
            Key contributions were made to enhance human capital management
            systems for the premier e-commerce platform in Iran, effectively
            collaborating on various modules designed to bolster employee
            engagement and organizational performance. The 'Kudos Module' was
            conceptualized and implemented to foster a positive workplace
            culture, alongside the development of a dynamic Access Management
            system to accurately tailor user permissions. Database queries
            were optimized to substantially improve system performance, and
            software deployments were managed with a rigorous focus on
            security and adherence to continuous integration practices in line
            with OWASP standards.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Karafs</strong>
          <p>
            A pivotal role was played in the strategic redesign of the Kerfes
            app’s shopping feature, leading to significant enhancements in the
            user interface and overall customer journey, which in turn
            resulted in increased conversion rates. RevenueCat was effectively
            integrated to facilitate seamless dollar-based transactions, thus
            expanding the app's presence in the global market. Collaboration
            with the development team on the migration of the codebase to
            NestJS improved scalability and maintainability, while active
            participation in code reviews and knowledge-sharing sessions
            promoted best practices and fostered a collaborative work
            environment.

        <li>
          <strong>Satek</strong>
          <p>
            Involved in the development of a purchase automation system
            designed for large-scale organizations, such as hospitals, in
            response to the needs of the IRI Ministry of Health. Utilized
            technologies including Node.js, PostgreSQL, TypeScript,
            TypeGraphQL, and TypeORM to ensure robust and efficient backend
            development. As the project progressed to deployment stages, plans
            were made to integrate MongoDB for enhanced performance and to
            prepare for future phases, including data mining capabilities.
